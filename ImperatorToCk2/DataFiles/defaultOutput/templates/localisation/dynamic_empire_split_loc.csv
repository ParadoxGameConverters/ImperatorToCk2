EVTDESC_IR_EMPIRE_SPLIT_e_TAG_1000;The tagEmpireName has for centuries dominated much of the world as an undisputed hegemon, with our power and sheer strength unmatched. However, such a gargantuan empire needs an equally massive bureaucracy in order to sustain itself, and we have pushed well beyond the limits of what our bureaucracy can handle, leaving the empire unmanageable, vastly overextended, and on the verge of collapse. In drastic times, drastic decisions must be made, and our best course of action is something that would have been unthinkable generations prior: Split the tagEmpireName in half, with an empire in the east and another in the west.

Only time will tell whether or not [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] will be remembered as the tagEmpireName's savior, or as the destroyer who hastened the tagEmpireName's demise, but regardless, the world order has fundamentally changed.;TAGEmpireAdj Split;TAGEmpireAdj Split;;TAGEmpireAdj Split;;;;;;;;;x
